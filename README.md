### What for

If you are actively developing or maintaining software based on **SQL Server** databases chances are your team is wasting time on tedious database tasks. Developers need to periodically refresh their sandbox databases from backups after trial functionality tests. Your databases might be complex making it hard for everyone to understand and learn about internal data processes. Database Administrators are busy copying and setting up security for new databases requested by various departments in your organization. For all of those and many more scenarios **Sandbox Database Manager** might prove a huge time saver.

### What is it

**Sandbox Database Manager** is a web application that serves as a fronted for all your database servers. From one central web location users will be able to copy databases from server to server, search and restore from backup files across all locations, search for data across all servers and all databases, backup databases to configured locations, create and use Database Snapshots to revert database changes, track data changes on databases, compare database data, monitor servers. All those features are implemented with security in mind and you will be able to configure access to each server and functionality at user level.
